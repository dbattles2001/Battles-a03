            have them enter a number until its a number (this is the scanner and checker bit)
            Do this for age and resting heart rate

            Afterwards print out those values as described

            begin a table using a loop where the loop prints rows of the table under
            "intensity | rate"
            "----------------"
            The loop of course uses the formula and before reiterating will += 5
            I'll have the printed percentage and percentage used in the formula be two
            different variables just for simplicities sake
