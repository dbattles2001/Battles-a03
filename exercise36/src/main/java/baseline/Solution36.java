        average function will take input from the number of numbers they chose to enter,
        which will be the denominator

        for that size, += the array into itself, then divide it by that number

        print that number

    /* max and min
        max and min will be two separate but very similar functions that will test themselves in a loop to find
        the highest and lowest values respectively.

        for example
        lowestNumber = array[0]

        for(denominator from before)
        if array[i] < lowestNumber
        lowestNumber = array[i]

        I don't remember the shorthand for the standard deviation formula, but i'll use it here.
