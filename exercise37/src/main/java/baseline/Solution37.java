            I think maybe the easiest way to do this one is first

            Ask the user how many numbers they want at least, save

            Ask them how many special characters, save

            Ask them how many numbers, save

            add those three into passwordLength and subtract it by two, which is now the length of an array named password.

            do a couple of for loops that go like this -
            for(number of special characters)
            password[i] = random special character from list i'll predetermine.
            numberHolder++

            for number of numbers + numberHolder
            passwordLength[i] = random number.
            numberHolder++

            for remainder of passwordLength
            insert random letters

            password is then scrambled and printed out.
